# Live streaming over multiple channels
Some special scenarios require streaming over two or more separate channels. Depending on the scenario, the app joins both channels as host, both channels as audience, or one channel as host and the other as audience. For example, consider the case of an online singing contest, where hosts of different channels interact with each other. The audience receives streams from two channels while the contestants broadcast to both channels.

Agora Video SDK multi-channel streaming allows you to join multiple channels at the same time and broadcast or receive audio and video over them. This page shows you how to implement two different multi-channel methods into your app using Video SDK. Choose the method that best fits your particular scenario.
