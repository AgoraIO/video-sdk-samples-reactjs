# Secure authentication with tokens

Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. Agora uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they access Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ to join a channel. Each token is valid for a limited period and works for specific and wildcard channel names.

This app authenticates the current user and channel with a token retrieved from a token server.
