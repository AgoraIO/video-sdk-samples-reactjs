# Audio and voice effects

Video SDK makes it simple for you to publish audio captured through the microphone to subscribers in a channel. In some cases, users want to modify the captured audio to add sound effects, mix in a pre-recorded audio, or change the voice quality before the audio is published. Video SDK provides several options that enable you to add sound effects, mix in pre-recorded audio, apply voice effects and set the audio route. This page shows you how to implement these features in your channel.

## Understand the tech

Using Video SDK you can implement the following audio feature:

* **Audio effects and audio mixing**

    Some real-time communication applications, such as online gaming and karaoke are built around audio mixing features. Playing a sound effect at the appropriate time or mixing background music with microphone audio is essential to such applications. Video SDK provides APIs that enable you to implement:

    * _Audio Effects_: Play audios with a short duration. For example, applause, cheers, and gunshots. You can play multiple audio effects at the same time.

    * _Audio Mixing_: Play longer music file, such as background music. Using audio mixing, you can play only one file at a time.
