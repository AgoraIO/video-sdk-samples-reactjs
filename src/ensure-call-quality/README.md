# Call quality best practice

Customer satisfaction for your Video Calling integrated app depends on the quality of video and audio it provides. Quality of audiovisual communication through your app is affected by the following factors:

- Bandwidth of network connection
- Stability of network connection
- Hardware quality
- Video and audio settings
- Echo
- Multiple users in a channel

This app shows you how to use Video SDK features to account for these factors and ensure optimal audio and video quality in your app.
