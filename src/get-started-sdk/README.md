# SDK quickstart

Video Calling enables one-to-one or small-group video chat connections with smooth, jitter-free streaming video. Agora’s Video SDK makes it easy to embed real-time video chat into web, mobile and native apps.

Thanks to Agora’s intelligent and global Software Defined Real-time Network (Agora SD-RTN™), you can rely on the highest available video and audio quality.

This app shows the minimum code you need to integrate high-quality, low-latency Video Calling features into your app 
using Video SDK.
